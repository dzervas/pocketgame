pocketgame is a simple bluetooth game controler, which should be compatible with
all OSes, as it uses a standard HID class (gamepad). Tested only on Android.

The schematic is a bit too simple and it offers no protection for anything
(over/under voltage, over/under current, short cricuit etc.) so be careful.
For example do NOT program the MCU in-circuit with a 5v programmer because RN-42
will smoke (RX and Vcc are directly soldered to the MCU and the MCU will start
talking 5v to the RN-42)
The device operates at 3v3 with 3v min and 3.7v max.

It uses 12 push buttons (2 right angle for L & R), a switch (for power supply),
an ATTiny2313, an RN-42 (in HID mode @56k baud), a battery socket, a LED, a
1kÎ© resistor (less/more according to the brightness you want, keep in mind that
the led will flash only when the device is not connected, so power draw is not
a problem) and a 20 pin socket (it's a REQUIREMENT! If you don't use a socket,
you'll have to desolder the MCU to progam it 'cause as said you can't program it
in-circuit!).
